# Install Gitpod Self-Hosted on Kubernetes

This section describes how to install Gitpod on any Kubernetes cluster using [Helm](https://helm.sh). This is the most flexible and generic way of installing Gitpod. The chart for stable releases resides in Helm repository [charts.gitpod.io](https://charts.gitpod.io), charts for branch-builds can be found [here](#install-branch-build), and the source of the charts is in our [public git repository](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/blob/main/chart/).

For some platforms we offer [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) scripts that ease the infrastructure setup. Once the script has created the necessary infrastructure it will output a `values.terraform.yaml` that contains infrastructure-specific configuration for the `helm` deployment.

- [Terraform for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](./install-on-gcp).

## Prerequisites

As we at Gitpod follow a ["Saas First" strategy](https://www.notion.so/gitpod/Gitpod-s-Direction-be35d064c0704fbda61c542b84e07ef6#57d3e4659c50449280411ac1f7dd1906) we have a <a class="no-nowrap" href="https://www.notion.so/gitpod/1b9eac5cb33d42e391f86a87f0e37836?v=4f2ec7c943514ee19203b9d4fe096094">very limited set of platforms that we support</a>.

You still might get Gitpod to run on other platforms (especially with the help of our [awesome community](https://community.gitpod.io/)) but there will be no support from Gitpod for those efforts.

Requirements regarding the Kubernetes the cluster:

- Workspace nodes require Ubuntu `= 18.04` as Host OS at the moment

- Gitpod should work on small Kubernetes nodes out of the box (2vCPUs, 8GB RAM). For a better experience we recommend at least 4vCPUs and 16GB RAM for workspaces nodes. For cost efficiency, we recommend to enable cluster-autoscaling.

You need the following "local" tools to follow this guide:

- `kubectl` with connection to your cluster

- `helm` in version `>= 3`.

## Installation

To install Gitpod in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. Create a file `values.custom.yaml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   rabbitmq:
     auth:
       username: your-rabbitmq-user
       password: your-secret-rabbitmq-password
   minio:
     accessKey: your-random-access-key
     secretKey: your-random-secret-key
   ```

   You should replace the keys with 2 different random strings unique for your installation.

1. Run the following commands in your local terminal:

   ```bash
   helm repo add gitpod.io https://charts.gitpod.io

   helm install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.9.0
   ```

1. Configure [domain and https](./configure-ingress).

1. Run `kubectl get pods` and verify that all pods are in state `RUNNING`. If some are not, please see the [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting).

1. Go to `https://<your-domain.com>` and follow the steps to complete the installation.

## Upgrade

1.  Check the [Upgrade Guide](./upgrade) and follow the steps outlined there.

1.  Run the update

    ```bash
    helm install -f values.custom.yaml gitpod gitpod.io/gitpod --version=0.9.0
    ```

1.  Run `kubectl get pods` and verify that all pods are in state `RUNNING`. If some are not, please see the [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting).

## Recommended Configuration

By default, the Helm chart installs a working Gitpod installation in a lot of scenarios. Yet, there are certain things you might want to review when installing Gitpod for long term use and/or a bigger audience:

- [**Database**](./database): Configure where Gitpod stores all internal runtime data.
- [**Storage**](./storage): Configure where Gitpod persists workspace content.
- [**Docker Registry**](./docker-registry): Configure where Gitpod stores workspace images.

## Customization

Further customizations:

- [**Kubernetes Nodes**](./nodes): Configure file system layout and the workspace's node associativity.
- [**Workspaces**](./workspaces): Configure workspace sizing.

## Install Branch Build

To try the latest version of Gitpod, freshly build form the `main` branch of our git repository or any other branch, follow these steps:

1. Obtain the version name from [werft.gitpod-dev.com](https://werft.gitpod-dev.com/). The version has the format `<branchname>.<buildnumber>` (e.g `main.354`).

2. The Helm chart ships as part of our `installer` docker image. You can extract it by running:
   ```bash
   docker run --entrypoint cp -v $PWD:/workspace gcr.io/gitpod-io/self-hosted/installer:<version> -R /dist/helm/ /workspace
   ```
